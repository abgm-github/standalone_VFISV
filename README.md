# standalone_VFISV

Milne-Eddington inversion code assuming a magnetic plus a non-magnetic component Milne-Eddington model for pixels fulfilling some polarization degree.

The code itself is a minor modification of the VFISV (Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector; Borrero et al. 2011; Centeno et al. 2014 and 
modified in May 2013 -Hoeksema et al. 2014-) found in the HMI processing pipeline.
